2. "Working Sheet": Cleaned dataset
3. "Pivot": Consists of pivot table and pivot charts
4. "Dashboard": Comprehensive dashboard with interactive pivot slicing



Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data to gain valuable insights and provide an interactive dashboard for comprehensive visualization. The project begins with the original dataset, which is then processed and cleaned in the "Working Sheet" to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Utilizing pivot tables and pivot charts, the "Pivot" sheet provides a summary analysis of the data, highlighting key trends, patterns, and performance metrics. Finally, the "Dashboard" sheet showcases an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that allows users to explore the data through pivot slicing, enabling deeper analysis and informed decision-making.

Through this project, you can explore the bike sales dataset, observe trends, and delve into the factors influencing sales performance. The dashboard's interactive features enhance the user experience, enabling dynamic slicing and filtering to examine specific metrics and segments. Whether you are interested in understanding customer preferences, analyzing sales performance across regions, or identifying popular age groups affecting sales, this project provides a comprehensive solution for visualizing and analyzing bike sales data.
